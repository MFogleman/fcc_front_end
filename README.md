# FCC Projects

These projects were created for [Free Code Camp's front-end-development program](http://www.freecodecamp.com/mfogleman)

I started the program back in November, 2015.  Some of these are... rough.  While I'd like to go back and refactor most of them, available time is a significant life factor.  Time spent re-factoring and perfecting old projects is time not spent learning new technologies and trying new things.  Nonetheless, feedback is always welcome.
